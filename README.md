# MATH 104B Final Presentation
### By: Ron Kibel, Param Bhullar, Angelina Verdugo

The Jupyter notebook above is an analysis of the Gram-Schmidt process and its modifications. We describe the

* Classical Gram-Schmidt Process
* Modified Gram-Schmidt Process

and its reorthogonalized counterparts, denoted

* CGS2 (Classical GS, reorthogonalized)
* MGS2 (Modified GS, reorthogonalized)

and how the condition number and norm of a randomly generated matrix affect the influence the round-off error in QR-orthogonalizability 

$$ \| I - Q^TQ \|_2 $$

and decomposability

$$ \| A - QR \|_2 $$
